                    <br> [Dec. 1979 Age 20]
                    <br> The Silver Case "Dispute among the Kanto Big 3 NGO Parties" Nonprofit Regional Citizen Group TRO/CCO Confederation Chairman Ginji Nakane was on his way to a symposium recording when he was assassinated outside the front door of TTV Station.

The assassination occurred on 12/7, the day of publication of corrections regarding the election of the new district mayor, a dispute between the FSO and the TRO/CCO. The perpetrator, Kamui Uehara, was immediately arrested upon commission of the crime. It was decided that he had acted alone and that the hit had been contracted, but the contractor was never found.
